# DA4BCI
 DA4BCI provides a suite of domain adaptation methods specifically designed for   EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. It implements a unified    interface for TCA, Subspace Alignment, MIDA, Riemannian Distance (RD),    Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK). These approaches    help mitigate distributional shifts across sessions or subjects, facilitating    robust classification in EEG data analysis. The package also offers utilities    for synthetic data generation and visualization, making it easier to experiment    with and evaluate domain adaptation techniques.
