Description: 
    Provides a comprehensive suite of domain adaptation methods tailored for 
    EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The package offers 
    a unified interface for numerous algorithms, including Transfer Component 
    Analysis (TCA), Subspace Alignment (SA), Maximum Independence Domain 
    Adaptation (MIDA), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK), 
    Aligned Riemannian Transport (ART), Parallel Transport (PT), Manifold-based 
    Multi-step Domain Adaptation (M3D), and Optimal Transport (OT). It also 
    includes a robust evaluation framework with functions to compute key 
    distance metrics like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Wasserstein Distance, 
    and Energy Distance. These tools help align EEG distributions across 
    sessions or subjects to mitigate data shifts and improve model robustness.
