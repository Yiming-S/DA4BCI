Description: 
  This package provides a suite of domain adaptation methods tailored for 
  EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. It implements a unified 
  interface to apply Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), Subspace Alignment (SA), 
  Maximum Independence Domain Adaptation (MIDA), Riemannian Distance (RD), 
  Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK). By aligning EEG 
  signals across sessions or subjects, these methods help mitigate distribution 
  shifts, facilitating more robust and accurate machine learning for BCI tasks.
  The package also offers convenient utilities for evaluation and visualization 
  of adaptation results.
