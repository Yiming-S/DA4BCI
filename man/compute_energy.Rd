\title{Compute Energy Distance}
\usage{
compute_energy(source, target)
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{A numeric matrix whose rows are observations and columns are
features (source domain).}

\item{target}{A numeric matrix with the same column structure as
\code{source} (target domain).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value giving the Energy Distance between
\code{source} and \code{target}.
}
\description{
The \code{compute_energy} function calculates the (squared-rooted) Energy
Distance between the empirical distributions represented by
\code{source} and \code{target}.  Energy Distance is a metric that, for
continuous data, is equivalent to Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with
a distance‚Äêinduced kernel and is widely used for two-sample testing and
domain-adaptation diagnostics.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{X,\,X'} be i.i.d.\ samples from the source distribution and
\eqn{Y,\,Y'} from the target distribution.  The population Energy
Distance is defined as
\deqn{D_E = \sqrt{2\,\mathbb{E}\|X-Y\|
  - \mathbb{E}\|X-X'\|
  - \mathbb{E}\|Y-Y'\|}\,.}
The estimator implemented here replaces the expectations by the
corresponding empirical means of pairwise Euclidean distances.  Numerical
precision is enforced by clamping negative arguments of the final square
root to zero.
